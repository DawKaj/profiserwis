There are different sorts of cookies: - session cookies which disappear as soon as the user leaves the browser or website; - permanent cookies which are stored until the expiry of their lifespan or validity, or until the user deletes them, for example, using their browser functionalities.

#### Deleting and/or rejecting cookies

There are several manners in which the user may delete and/or reject cookies and other trackers or similar technologies.

They may also configure their browser (manipulation required for each terminal: tablets, smartphones, computers, etc.) to accept or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis prior to their installation. Users may also delete the cookies on a regular basis from their terminal through their browser.

Each browser is configured differently for the management of cookies and user preferences. The configuration is described in the browser's help menu which enables the user to find out how to modify their preferences regarding cookies. For example: - for Internet Explorer™ : https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies ; - for Edge : https://privacy.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy ; - for Safari™ : http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/fr-ww/cookies/ et http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/fr-ww/ ; - for Chrome™: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=fr&hlrm=en ; - for Firefox™ : https://support.mozilla.org/fr/kb/activer-desactiver-cookies-preferences ; - for Opera™ : http://help.opera.com/Windows/10.20/fr/cookies.html.
